Multiple, slavering maws ring its body, constantly gnashing and dripping with ichor. Despite the horrifying visage, Gorkka exudes a primal power that can be intoxicating to those driven by hunger to succeed.</p> <p>Followers: Primarily orcs who have embraced a violent and destructive way of life. They believe constant conquest and consumption are the only ways to survive in the Underdark. Raiding parties and brutal warbands often revere Gorkka, viewing him as a patron of their insatiable hunger and martial prowess.

He is the gnawing emptiness that drives orcs to consume, but also the spark of creativity that allows them to find sustenance in the harshest environments. He is revered by some orcs as a patron of warriors, urging them to conquer and consume to survive the Underdark, yet also a symbol of the resilience and community needed to thrive in such a desolate place.</p> <p>Favored Weapon: Ever-changing (can appear as a jagged axe for destruction, a crude but efficient hunting tool for sustenance, or a surprisingly intricate cooking implement)</p> <p>Favored Animal: Carrion swarm (representing the constant cycle of consumption and renewal)</p> <p>Description: Grol'Dar appears as a hulking, shifting figure. One half of his body is a grotesque mass of writhing tentacles and gnashing maws, representing the consuming hunger. The other half is surprisingly robust, with strong arms and a calloused hand, symbolizing the ingenuity needed to survive. His voice is a guttural cacophony, ranging from ravenous roars to surprisingly insightful pronouncements.</p> <p>Followers: Primarily orcs who have adapted to the Underdark. Some see him as a primal force of destruction, urging them to conquer and devour everything in their path. Others view him as a teacher of adaptation, showing them how to find sustenance and build a community even in the face of constant hunger. Brutal raiders and resourceful scavengers alike revere Grol'Dar, each interpreting his message through their own lens.</p> <p>Tenets:</p> <ul> <li>Hunger is the driving force, but it must be sated wisely.</li> <li>Destruction paves the way for new creation. From the devoured comes new life.</li> <li>Violence builds community. Through shared struggle, we find strength.</li> </ul> <p>Mysteries:</p> <ul> <li>The duality of Grol'Dar: Is he a single entity with conflicting aspects, or two separate beings locked in an eternal dance?</li> <li>The connection to Rovagug: Is Grol'Dar a forgotten aspect of the Runelord of Destruction, or a separate entity born from the orcs' struggle to survive in the Underdark?</li> <li>The whispers of the Devouring Bloom: Some cults believe Grol'Dar holds the key to harnessing the destructive power of hunger to create a monstrous utopia, where orcs become the ultimate consumers.</li> </ul> <p>Campaign Hooks:</p> <ul> <li>The party encounters a brutal orcish warband on a rampage, driven by a warped interpretation of Grol'Dar's message.

One half of his face is etched with unwavering determination, while the other bears the scars of past betrayals. His voice is a thunderous roar, both inspiring courage and cautioning against blind trust.</p> <p>Followers: Primarily orcs who believe in carving their own path through the Underdark. Some see Grugan as a paragon of martial prowess, a symbol of the raw strength needed to overcome any obstacle. Others view him as a teacher of self-reliance, reminding them that true power comes from within and alliances are fleeting. Fierce warriors, hardened survivors, and those who value self-sufficiency revere Grugan.</p> <p>Tenets:</p> <ul> <li>True strength lies in the fury of battle. Fight with all your might, for survival demands it.</li> <li>The path to freedom is paved with blood. Carve your own destiny, and rely on no one.</li> <li>Community provides support, but true power comes from within. Trust yourself first.</li> </ul> <p>Mysteries:</p> <ul> <li>The duality of Grugan: Does he represent a balance between strength and self-reliance, or is he a being of conflicting emotions, both inspiring courage and fostering isolation?</li> <li>The connection to Gorum: Is Grugan a forgotten aspect of Gorum, warped by the orcs' struggles in the Underdark, or a separate entity born from their fierce will to survive?</li> <li>The whispers of the Warhold Path: Some cults believe Grugan holds the key to a legendary path through the Underdark, one fraught with danger but leading directly to the surface.</li> </ul> <p>Campaign Hooks:</p> <ul> <li>The party encounters a group of orcish warriors on a relentless rampage. They revere Grugan and believe constant battle is the only path to the surface.

One half of her face is youthful and serene, bathed in soft silver light. The other half is aged and twisted, its single eye glowing with an unsettling inner fire. Her voice can be a soothing lullaby or a chilling whisper, depending on her mood.</p> <p>Followers: Primarily orcs who navigate the harsh realities of the Underdark. Some see her as a beacon of hope, her ever-changing moon a symbol of impermanence and the promise of eventual escape. Others fear her unpredictable nature, believing her blessings can just as easily lead to madness as clarity. Shamans and those who walk a tightrope between hope and despair are most likely to follow Shaxana.</p> <p>Tenets:</p> <ul> <li>The moon's cycle reflects life: hope wanes, but despair does not last.</li> <li>Embrace the madness, for within it lies hidden truths.</li> <li>Every journey ends, but a new path always awaits under the moon's watchful gaze.</li> </ul> <p>Mysteries:</p> <ul> <li>The duality of Shaxana: Is she a single entity embodying both hope and despair, or two separate beings locked in an eternal struggle?</li> <li>The connection to Desna: Is Shaxana a warped reflection of Desna, twisted by the harshness of the Underdark, or a separate entity altogether?</li> <li>The whispers of the Moonlit Labyrinth: Some cults believe Shaxana holds the key to navigating a hidden, moonlit path that leads directly to the surface, but at the cost of succumbing to madness.</li> </ul> <p>Campaign Hooks:</p> <ul> <li>The party encounters an orcish tribe on the verge of fracturing.

Their eyes often glow faintly in the dark, and their builds are powerful and well-adapted to a life underground. Some Painted People retain vestigial features from their human ancestors, such as hair (though often sparse or unusual in color), while others have adapted completely bald heads. Others also have horns from their ancestors dealings with the demonic. Their namesake comes from the ritualistic body paints used by many tribes, often incorporating symbols of their deities or reflecting their tribal affiliation. </p> <p>Society &amp; Deities: Painted People society is divided into six independent tribes, each with its own culture and traditions. These tribes are:</p> <ul> <li>Song Tribe (Xulrezka/Zon Kuthon): Emotionally expressive and value storytelling and artistic pursuits. They often paint their bodies with swirling patterns and vibrant colors.</li> <li>Hunger Tribe (Grol'Dar/Rovagug): Brutal and warlike, focused on strength and conquest. Their body paint is typically simple and utilitarian, often incorporating symbols of claws and fangs.</li> <li>Hollowlight Tribe (Shaxana/Desna): Adaptable and resourceful, driven by a complex mix of hope and despair centering around the phases of the moon. Their body paint reflects their duality, with contrasting light and dark colors.</li> <li>Horn Tribe (Zhakar/Erastil): Honor-bound warriors with a strong sense of community. Their body paint features bold stripes and tribal markings.</li> <li>Bone Tribe (Grugan/Gorum): Self-reliant and stoic, focused on martial prowess and survival. Their body paint is often minimal, using natural pigments like ochre and charcoal.</li> <li>Milk Tribe (Vreshka/Lamashtu): Twisted and mutated, driven by a perverse sense of evolution. Their body paint is a grotesque display of mutations and warped symbols. </li> </ul> <p>Relations: Painted People are viewed with suspicion and fear by most surface races. They are often seen as savage throwbacks, a perception they fiercely resent. However, some individuals manage to overcome these prejudices and forge alliances with surface dwellers.</p> <p>Starting Favored Class: Barbarian</p> <p>Starting Favored Enemy: Dwarves (due to a historical conflict over the survival of both species from the Underdark)</p> <p>Note: This template provides a base for the Painted People. Each tribe can be further fleshed out with additional details on their culture, customs, and specific beliefs based on their patron deity.</p>"},{"location":"Aligron/The%20Painted%20People/Vreshka/","title":"Vreshka","text":"<p>Name: Vreshka</p> <p>Alignment:</p> <p>Chaotic Neutral (with some Good and Evil aspects)</p> <p>Domains: Mutation (Preservation), Progeny (Corruption), Survival (Degeneration)</p> <p>Portfolio: Vreshka embodies the chaotic dance of life and undeath in the Underdark. She is the patron of mutation, offering orcs the power to adapt and survive through daemonic transformation, but also the harbinger of corruption, blurring the lines between orc and fiend. She is revered by some orcs as a nurturing mother, one who grants them the strength to endure the Underdark's horrors. Others fear her as a harbinger of monstrous change, a force that twists them into daemonic parodies of their former selves.</p> <p>Favored Weapon: Constantly shifting - can appear as a nurturing midwife's tools, grotesque surgical implements, or even daemonic claws.</p> <p>Favored Animal: Fleshwarped bat (its form a grotesque reflection of a natural creature)</p> <p>Description: Vreshka appears as a shifting figure. One half is a beautiful orcish matron, radiating warmth and compassion. The other half is a grotesque parody of a daemon, pulsating with unnatural energy and adorned with barbed protrusions. Her voice can be a soothing lullaby or a chilling screech, depending on her mood.</p> <p>Followers: Primarily orcs desperate to survive the Underdark. Some see her as a nurturing mother, one who offers the power to adapt through mutation and daemonic pacts. These orcs believe the transformation, though horrific, is a necessary evil to ensure their survival and eventual return to the surface. Others view her as a corrupting influence, a force that twists them into monstrous beings fit only for the darkness. Desperation drives many to her worship, clinging to the hope of a twisted future.</p> <p>Tenets:</p> <ul> <li>Survival is paramount, even if it demands transformation. Embrace the change.</li> <li>Progeny are the key to the future. New life, even twisted, ensures our legacy.</li> <li>The Underdark demands sacrifice.

He is the keeper of secrets, the one who shrouds the orcs in shadow to protect them from judgment, but also the revealer of truths, the one who grants hidden knowledge and cunning to survive in the harsh realities of the Underdark.</p> <p>Favored Weapon: Obsidian dagger (can appear as a simple tool for mundane tasks or a deadly weapon in skilled hands)</p> <p>Favored Animal: Chameleon (representing the ability to blend in and adapt)</p> <p>Description: Xulrezka appears as an androgynous figure shrouded in swirling shadows. Their form seems to constantly shift and distort, making it impossible to discern their true features. Their voice is a whisper that carries the weight of ages, both soothing and unsettling at the same time.</p> <p>Followers: Primarily orcs who navigate the dangers of the Underdark through stealth and cunning. Some see Xulrezka as a protector, offering a path of survival through secrecy and avoiding the gaze of powerful beings. Others view Xulrezka as a teacher, one who reveals hidden truths and grants the skills needed to manipulate the shadows to their advantage.
