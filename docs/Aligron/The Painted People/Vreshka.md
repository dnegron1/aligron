**Name:** Vreshka

**Alignment:**

Chaotic Neutral (with some Good and Evil aspects)

**Domains:** Mutation (Preservation), Progeny (Corruption), Survival (Degeneration)

**Portfolio:** Vreshka embodies the chaotic dance of life and undeath in the Underdark. She is the patron of mutation, offering orcs the power to adapt and survive through daemonic transformation, but also the harbinger of corruption, blurring the lines between orc and fiend. She is revered by some orcs as a nurturing mother, one who grants them the strength to endure the Underdark's horrors. Others fear her as a harbinger of monstrous change, a force that twists them into daemonic parodies of their former selves.

**Favored Weapon:** Constantly shifting - can appear as a nurturing midwife's tools, grotesque surgical implements, or even daemonic claws.

**Favored Animal:** Fleshwarped bat (its form a grotesque reflection of a natural creature)

**Description:** Vreshka appears as a shifting figure. One half is a beautiful orcish matron, radiating warmth and compassion. The other half is a grotesque parody of a daemon, pulsating with unnatural energy and adorned with barbed protrusions. Her voice can be a soothing lullaby or a chilling screech, depending on her mood.

**Followers:** Primarily orcs desperate to survive the Underdark. Some see her as a nurturing mother, one who offers the power to adapt through mutation and daemonic pacts. These orcs believe the transformation, though horrific, is a necessary evil to ensure their survival and eventual return to the surface. Others view her as a corrupting influence, a force that twists them into monstrous beings fit only for the darkness. Desperation drives many to her worship, clinging to the hope of a twisted future.

**Tenets:**

- Survival is paramount, even if it demands transformation. Embrace the change.
- Progeny are the key to the future. New life, even twisted, ensures our legacy.
- The Underdark demands sacrifice. Give in to its darkness, and it will grant you strength.

**Mysteries:**

- The duality of Vreshka: Is she a single entity with conflicting desires, or two beings locked in an eternal struggle?
- The connection to Lamashtu: Is Vreshka a forgotten aspect of Lamashtu, twisted by the harshness of the Underdark, or a separate entity empowered by the orcs' desperation?
- The whispers of the Mutated Brood: Some cults believe Vreshka will usher in an era of monstrous transformation, where orcs and daemons merge into a single, dominant race.

**Campaign Hooks:**

- The party encounters a hidden orcish settlement deep within the Underdark. The orcs appear monstrously mutated, yet revere Vreshka as their savior. Can the party find a way to help them survive without succumbing to further corruption?
- A charismatic warlord emerges, preaching Vreshka's message of transformation and promising to create an army of monstrous orcs to conquer the surface world. The party must find a way to dismantle his cult and prevent a war fueled by desperation and dark magic.
- Ancient murals depicting monstrous orcs and twisted rituals dedicated to Vreshka are discovered. Deciphering these murals may reveal a way to sever the link between the orcs and Vreshka, or unleash a wave of uncontrolled mutation upon the Underdark.
