**Alignment:** Painted People tend towards neutral alignments, with strong leanings based on their specific tribe's deity (see Tribe Deities below).

**Size Description:** Painted People are typically Medium sized, similar to humans, but with a more stocky and muscular build.

**Physical Description:** Painted People skin tones range from a pale, bioluminescent white (Hollowlight Tribe) to a deep, almost obsidian black (Milk Tribe). Their eyes often glow faintly in the dark, and their builds are powerful and well-adapted to a life underground. Some Painted People retain vestigial features from their human ancestors, such as hair (though often sparse or unusual in color), while others have adapted completely bald heads. Others also have horns from their ancestors dealings with the demonic. Their namesake comes from the ritualistic body paints used by many tribes, often incorporating symbols of their deities or reflecting their tribal affiliation. 

**Society & Deities:** Painted People society is divided into six independent tribes, each with its own culture and traditions. These tribes are:

- **Song Tribe ([[Xulrezka]]/Zon Kuthon):** Emotionally expressive and value storytelling and artistic pursuits. They often paint their bodies with swirling patterns and vibrant colors.
- **Hunger Tribe ([[Grol'Dar]]/Rovagug):** Brutal and warlike, focused on strength and conquest. Their body paint is typically simple and utilitarian, often incorporating symbols of claws and fangs.
- **Hollowlight Tribe ([[Shaxana]]/Desna):** Adaptable and resourceful, driven by a complex mix of hope and despair centering around the phases of the moon. Their body paint reflects their duality, with contrasting light and dark colors.
- **Horn Tribe ([[Zhakar]]/Erastil):** Honor-bound warriors with a strong sense of community. Their body paint features bold stripes and tribal markings.
- **Bone Tribe ([[Grugan]]/Gorum):** Self-reliant and stoic, focused on martial prowess and survival. Their body paint is often minimal, using natural pigments like ochre and charcoal.
- **Milk Tribe ([[Vreshka]]/Lamashtu):** Twisted and mutated, driven by a perverse sense of evolution. Their body paint is a grotesque display of mutations and warped symbols. 

**Relations:** Painted People are viewed with suspicion and fear by most surface races. They are often seen as savage throwbacks, a perception they fiercely resent. However, some individuals manage to overcome these prejudices and forge alliances with surface dwellers.

**Starting Favored Class:** Barbarian

**Starting Favored Enemy:** Dwarves (due to a historical conflict over the survival of both species from the Underdark)

**Note:** This template provides a base for the Painted People. Each tribe can be further fleshed out with additional details on their culture, customs, and specific beliefs based on their patron deity.
