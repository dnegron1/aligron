**Name:** Shaxana

**Alignment:** Neutral (with Chaotic and Good aspects)

**Domains:** Hope (Despair), Moon (Madness), Travel (Loss)

**Portfolio:** Shaxana embodies the duality of the moon, the ever-shifting cycle of hope and despair, clarity and madness, and the promise of a new beginning intertwined with the sting of loss. She is a complex figure revered by some orcs for offering solace and guidance in the Underdark, yet feared for the unpredictable nature of her blessings.

**Favored Weapon:** Ever-changing (sometimes a shimmering scimitar, other times a barbed whip)

**Favored Animal:** Lunar moth (their erratic flight patterns mirroring the duality of Shaxana)

**Description:** Shaxana appears as a veiled figure cloaked in swirling moonlight. One half of her face is youthful and serene, bathed in soft silver light. The other half is aged and twisted, its single eye glowing with an unsettling inner fire. Her voice can be a soothing lullaby or a chilling whisper, depending on her mood.

**Followers:** Primarily orcs who navigate the harsh realities of the Underdark. Some see her as a beacon of hope, her ever-changing moon a symbol of impermanence and the promise of eventual escape. Others fear her unpredictable nature, believing her blessings can just as easily lead to madness as clarity. Shamans and those who walk a tightrope between hope and despair are most likely to follow Shaxana.

**Tenets:**

- The moon's cycle reflects life: hope wanes, but despair does not last.
- Embrace the madness, for within it lies hidden truths.
- Every journey ends, but a new path always awaits under the moon's watchful gaze.

**Mysteries:**

- The duality of Shaxana: Is she a single entity embodying both hope and despair, or two separate beings locked in an eternal struggle?
- The connection to Desna: Is Shaxana a warped reflection of Desna, twisted by the harshness of the Underdark, or a separate entity altogether?
- The whispers of the Moonlit Labyrinth: Some cults believe Shaxana holds the key to navigating a hidden, moonlit path that leads directly to the surface, but at the cost of succumbing to madness.

**Campaign Hooks:**

- The party encounters an orcish tribe on the verge of fracturing. One faction clings to hope in Shaxana's teachings, while the other succumbs to despair. Can the party help them find balance, or will the tribe be consumed by the moon's duality?
- A charismatic leader emerges, promising to unlock Shaxana's full power and lead the orcs to the surface through the Moonlit Labyrinth. The party must expose the dangers of this path and the potential for mass madness.
- Ancient ruins dedicated to Shaxana are discovered, containing cryptic murals depicting both hope and despair. Deciphering these murals may reveal a way to appease Shaxana and secure safe passage for the orcs, or unleash a wave of unpredictable lunar magic upon the Underdark
