**Name:** Xulrezka

**Alignment:** Lawful Neutral (with some Chaotic tendencies)

**Domains:** Secrets (Revelation), Shadow (Illumination), Order (Deception)

**Portfolio:** Xulrezka embodies the duality of hidden knowledge. He is the keeper of secrets, the one who shrouds the orcs in shadow to protect them from judgment, but also the revealer of truths, the one who grants hidden knowledge and cunning to survive in the harsh realities of the Underdark.

**Favored Weapon:** Obsidian dagger (can appear as a simple tool for mundane tasks or a deadly weapon in skilled hands)

**Favored Animal:** Chameleon (representing the ability to blend in and adapt)

**Description:** Xulrezka appears as an androgynous figure shrouded in swirling shadows. Their form seems to constantly shift and distort, making it impossible to discern their true features. Their voice is a whisper that carries the weight of ages, both soothing and unsettling at the same time.

**Followers:** Primarily orcs who navigate the dangers of the Underdark through stealth and cunning. Some see Xulrezka as a protector, offering a path of survival through secrecy and avoiding the gaze of powerful beings. Others view Xulrezka as a teacher, one who reveals hidden truths and grants the skills needed to manipulate the shadows to their advantage. Scouts, spies, and those who walk a tightrope between order and deception are most likely to follow Xulrezka.

**Tenets:**

- The greatest truths are hidden in the shadows. Seek knowledge, but be wary of revelation.
- Order thrives in the darkness. Deception is a tool, not a vice. Use it to survive.
- True freedom comes from escaping judgment. Remain unseen, unheard.

**Mysteries:**

- The duality of Xulrezka: Does Xulrezka truly offer order and survival, or is their ultimate goal to keep the orcs shrouded in ignorance and easy to manipulate?
- The connection to Zon-Kuthon: Is Xulrezka a forgotten aspect of Zon-Kuthon, or a separate entity empowered by the orcs' need for secrecy?
- The whispers of the Unseen Path: Some cults believe Xulrezka holds the key to a hidden network of tunnels that allows the orcs to bypass dangers and reach the surface world unseen.

**Campaign Hooks:**

- The party encounters an orcish spy ring operating in a major city, adept at using shadows and manipulation to further their goals. Do they serve a greater purpose, or are they a rogue faction driven by their own agenda?
- A charismatic leader emerges, promising to use Xulrezka's teachings to bring complete order to the Underdark, shrouding everything in perpetual darkness. The party must expose the dangers of such an existence and the potential loss of knowledge and individuality.
- Ancient ruins dedicated to Xulrezka are discovered, containing cryptic texts hinting at both powerful hidden truths and the dangers of succumbing to deception. Deciphering these texts may reveal a way to benefit from Xulrezka's knowledge without falling prey to their manipulative tendencies.
