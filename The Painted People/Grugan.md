**Name:** Grugan

**Alignment:**

Chaotic Neutral (with some Lawful tendencies)

**Domains:** Strength (Valor), War, Community (Isolation)

**Portfolio:** Grugan embodies the paradoxical strength needed for the orcs' survival in the Underdark. He is the champion of bravery in combat, urging them to fight for their place in the harsh world, but also a symbol of fierce independence, reminding them to rely on their own strength and not become dependent on others.

**Favored Weapon:** Massive warhammer (can appear simple and brutal or surprisingly well-crafted depending on the situation)

**Favored Animal:** Lone wolverine (representing both ferocious fighting spirit and a solitary nature)

**Description:** Grugan appears as a towering orcish warrior, his body a testament to countless battles. One half of his face is etched with unwavering determination, while the other bears the scars of past betrayals. His voice is a thunderous roar, both inspiring courage and cautioning against blind trust.

**Followers:** Primarily orcs who believe in carving their own path through the Underdark. Some see Grugan as a paragon of martial prowess, a symbol of the raw strength needed to overcome any obstacle. Others view him as a teacher of self-reliance, reminding them that true power comes from within and alliances are fleeting. Fierce warriors, hardened survivors, and those who value self-sufficiency revere Grugan.

**Tenets:**

- True strength lies in the fury of battle. Fight with all your might, for survival demands it.
- The path to freedom is paved with blood. Carve your own destiny, and rely on no one.
- Community provides support, but true power comes from within. Trust yourself first.

**Mysteries:**

- The duality of Grugan: Does he represent a balance between strength and self-reliance, or is he a being of conflicting emotions, both inspiring courage and fostering isolation?
- The connection to Gorum: Is Grugan a forgotten aspect of Gorum, warped by the orcs' struggles in the Underdark, or a separate entity born from their fierce will to survive?
- The whispers of the Warhold Path: Some cults believe Grugan holds the key to a legendary path through the Underdark, one fraught with danger but leading directly to the surface.

**Campaign Hooks:**

- The party encounters a group of orcish warriors on a relentless rampage. They revere Grugan and believe constant battle is the only path to the surface. Can the party reason with them, or must they be stopped?
- A hidden orcish society thrives deep within the Underdark, fiercely independent and distrustful of outsiders. They revere Grugan as a symbol of self-reliance. The party may need to earn their trust to gain passage or assistance.
- Ancient ruins dedicated to Grugan are discovered, containing murals depicting glorious victories and cautionary tales of betrayal. Deciphering these murals may reveal forgotten tactics for navigating the Underdark or a warning against misplaced trust.
