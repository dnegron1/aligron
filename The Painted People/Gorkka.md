**Name:** Gorkka

**Alignment:**

Chaotic Evil

**Domains:** Strength (War), Hunger, Consumption

**Portfolio:** Gorkka embodies the primal urge to consume, the unending hunger that drives all living things. He is revered by some orcs as the patron of warriors, urging them to conquer and devour to survive the harsh realities of the Underdark.

**Favored Weapon:** Massive, jagged cleaver

**Favored Animal:** Swarm of ravenous locusts

**Description:** Gorkka appears as a grotesque amalgamation of flesh and bone, perpetually ravenous and pulsating with raw power. Multiple, slavering maws ring its body, constantly gnashing and dripping with ichor. Despite the horrifying visage, Gorkka exudes a primal power that can be intoxicating to those driven by hunger to succeed.

**Followers:** Primarily orcs who have embraced a violent and destructive way of life. They believe constant conquest and consumption are the only ways to survive in the Underdark. Raiding parties and brutal warbands often revere Gorkka, viewing him as a patron of their insatiable hunger and martial prowess. However, some orcs see this worship as a path to madness and self-destruction, a descent into mindless savagery.

**Tenets:**

- To survive, one must consume. Take what you need, and devour the rest.
- Strength is the only virtue. The weak are meant to be food for the strong.
- Conquest is the only path to satiation. Never stop consuming.

**Mysteries:**

- The unending hunger: Is Gorkka simply a primal embodiment of hunger, or is there a deeper intelligence behind his insatiable urges?
- The connection to Rovagug: Is Gorkka a forgotten aspect of the Runelord of Destruction, or a separate entity fueled by the Underdark's harsh environment?
- The endless cycle of consumption: Does Gorkka's worship offer a path to true survival, or does it doom his followers to a never-ending cycle of violence and destruction?

**Campaign Hooks:**

- The party encounters an orcish warband on a rampage, fueled by their devotion to Gorkka and their insatiable hunger. Can they be reasoned with, or must they be stopped?
- A hidden temple to Gorkka is discovered, rumored to hold a ritual that can unleash a monstrous avatar of hunger upon the world.
- A charismatic warlord emerges, preaching Gorkka's message of conquest and promising to satiate the hunger of all orcs by consuming the surface world. The party must find a way to dismantle his cult and prevent a catastrophic war.
