**Name:** Grol'Dar

**Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral (with some Evil tendencies)

**Domains:** Hunger (Sustenance), Destruction (Creation), Violence (Community)

**Portfolio:** Grol'Dar embodies the primal duality of hunger. He is the gnawing emptiness that drives orcs to consume, but also the spark of creativity that allows them to find sustenance in the harshest environments. He is revered by some orcs as a patron of warriors, urging them to conquer and consume to survive the Underdark, yet also a symbol of the resilience and community needed to thrive in such a desolate place.

**Favored Weapon:** Ever-changing (can appear as a jagged axe for destruction, a crude but efficient hunting tool for sustenance, or a surprisingly intricate cooking implement)

**Favored Animal:** Carrion swarm (representing the constant cycle of consumption and renewal)

**Description:** Grol'Dar appears as a hulking, shifting figure. One half of his body is a grotesque mass of writhing tentacles and gnashing maws, representing the consuming hunger. The other half is surprisingly robust, with strong arms and a calloused hand, symbolizing the ingenuity needed to survive. His voice is a guttural cacophony, ranging from ravenous roars to surprisingly insightful pronouncements.

**Followers:** Primarily orcs who have adapted to the Underdark. Some see him as a primal force of destruction, urging them to conquer and devour everything in their path. Others view him as a teacher of adaptation, showing them how to find sustenance and build a community even in the face of constant hunger. Brutal raiders and resourceful scavengers alike revere Grol'Dar, each interpreting his message through their own lens.

**Tenets:**

- Hunger is the driving force, but it must be sated wisely.
- Destruction paves the way for new creation. From the devoured comes new life.
- Violence builds community. Through shared struggle, we find strength.

**Mysteries:**

- The duality of Grol'Dar: Is he a single entity with conflicting aspects, or two separate beings locked in an eternal dance?
- The connection to Rovagug: Is Grol'Dar a forgotten aspect of the Runelord of Destruction, or a separate entity born from the orcs' struggle to survive in the Underdark?
- The whispers of the Devouring Bloom: Some cults believe Grol'Dar holds the key to harnessing the destructive power of hunger to create a monstrous utopia, where orcs become the ultimate consumers.

**Campaign Hooks:**

- The party encounters a brutal orcish warband on a rampage, driven by a warped interpretation of Grol'Dar's message. They believe only through endless destruction can they appease their hunger and create a new world.
- A hidden network of orcish scavengers emerges, surprisingly adept at finding sustenance in the Underdark. They revere Grol'Dar as a teacher of adaptation, and may hold the key to peaceful coexistence between orcs and other races.
- Ancient ruins dedicated to Grol'Dar are discovered, containing murals depicting both monstrous consumption and surprisingly intricate farming techniques. Deciphering these murals may reveal a way to appease both sides of Grol'Dar and create a sustainable future for the orcs.
